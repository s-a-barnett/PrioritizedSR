Location of experiment scripts. `sequential_no_act.py` and `sequential.py` refer to Experiments 1 and 2 of Momennejad et al. (2017), respectively, and `six_rooms.py` refers to the Six Rooms experiment.

To run all of the experiments, execute `run.sh` while this directory is your current working directory. This collects all of the data sequentially -- for fast collection we recommend modifying the script to parallelize across multiple nodes.
